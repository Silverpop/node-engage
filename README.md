node-engage
===========

This is a node.js library for interacting with the IBM Marketing Cloud (previously known as Silverpop Engage). It is not an exhaustive implementation of the IBM Marketing Cloud API. Rather, it provides an extensible base for implementing API method functionality, and it is intended to give potential IBM Marketing Cloud API developers a good starting place for their Node.js projects. This project is maintained by engineers from the IBM Marketing Cloud Professional Services department in our spare time, and other developers are welcome to fork new versions.

Please note: the IBM Marketing Cloud API is only available to current customers and partners of IBM who have active IBM Marketing Cloud licenses. If you are not currently a customer, this project will probably not be useful to you.

For additional information, see the following files under the [docs](docs) subdirectory:

* [preparation.md](docs/preparation.md) - instructions for preparing to use the library
* [usage.md](docs/usage.md) - general library usage instructions
* [methods.md](docs/methods.md) - specific method usage documentation
